1) Copy ALL files to your webserver, NOTE the name of the public folder "public_html" where index.php is<br>

   If public folder is not named public_html rename the folder public_html to match (public, home etc)\
   Only the contents of public_html go in the public folder.
   
   if you rename public_html you must also adjust the htaccess\
   .htaccess\
   RewriteRule ^$ public_html/ [L]\
   RewriteRule (.*) public_html/$1 [L]

   For xampp only the public_html/htaccess might need ajusting<br>
   RewriteBase /TorrentTraderMVC/public_html
